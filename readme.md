# fritzbox-blacklist

> FritzBox Routers can __only__ blacklist up to __500 domains__. I am using [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net/), because of this constraint.

Translates one of [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) file to a AVM FritzBox
readable blacklist format.

Here's how you add blacklists to your [fritzbox](https://en.avm.de/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7490/knowledge-base/publication/show/3395_Creating-filter-lists-for-websites/).

I personally use the `Unified hosts + fakenews + gambling` from StevenBlack/hosts.

Feel free to use the script.
